# ZZPlot 
**What is zzplot?**

ZZPlot offers a powerful platform for visualizing data using Z scores. Users can Experiment with different datasets and customize options to gain valuable insights from your data.

**How to use it**
- Begin by inputting your data for the x and y axes. This would utilize the provided space to generate your ZZPlot. You can also customize your plot by adjusting the data points and zones (deep, mid, sup zone) as needed.
- You can explore the capability to visualize multiple genes simultaneously on the ZZPlot. Input various genes and observe their distributions and correlations within the plot.
- *Distribution table* : Users can access the Distribution Table feature to view the most correlated genes. Please utilize this information to refine your visualization by selecting correlated genes to add to the plot.

# Analysis modes
**Mode 1 : Use Gradient Color**:
- This mode allows analysis of two selected genes simultaneously. Upon selection, the distribution tables on the right display the analysis results for each gene. You can utilize this mode to gain insights into the relationship between the two selected genes.

**Mode 2 : Use Cell Selection**:
- In this mode, you can select multiple genes for analysis. After ZZPlot is generated, hit the "Run" button to perform statistical tests. This feature identifies candidate cells based on the selected genes and displays highly correlated genes in order.
- Adjust the area of the plot using the "High", "Low", and "Absent" options to refine your analysis.

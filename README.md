**What is zzplot?**
ZZPlot offers a powerful platform for visualizing data using Z scores. Users can Experiment with different datasets and customize options to gain valuable insights from your data.

**How to use**
- Begin by inputting your data for the x and y axes. This would utilize the provided space to generate your ZZPlot. You can also customize your plot by adjusting the data points and zones (deep, mid, sup zone) as needed.
- You can explore the capability to visualize multiple genes simultaneously on the ZZPlot. Input various genes and observe their distributions and correlations within the plot.
- *Distribution table* : User can access the Distribution Table feature to view the most correlated genes. Please utilize this information to refine your visualization by selecting correlated genes to add to the plot.
